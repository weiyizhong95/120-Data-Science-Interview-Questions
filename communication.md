#### 1. Explain to me a technical concept related to the role that you’re interviewing for.
   - Overfitting often occurs when we are building  a model. When we train a model that fits very well on the traning data, but it does bad job on test data,
   there is a high possibility that the model is overfitting. Because the model learns all details and noises in the training data, but not every dataset comes 
   the same, and it will not fit the new data.
        
   - Overfitting comes usually with nonparametric and nonlinear models, such as random forest, decision trees.
        
   - How to solve: 1. feed more data. 2. use L1 or L2 to make regularization. 3. drop out unimportant features. 4. do cross-validation 5. reduce dememsion
